1. Compilation and execution

1.1 Building
	In order to build and run this project you need to have installed Java and Apache Ant on your machine. 

1.2 Running
	To run the program, execute run “make” from the main directory and after that ./scripts/mincaml followed by such command line options as (“-h”, “-v”). If the compiler is run with no command line 	arguments, the hit will be displayed. 
	For example: ./scripts/mincaml -v will print the current version number of our application.
	If such error occurs: “bash: ./scripts/mincamlc: Permission denied” it is needed to change permission of mincamlc to “allow execution file as a program” or run this: “chmod -R 755 <path to folder TEAM1>”.
    We faced the problem of executing the rest of command line options in terminal that require proved parser. The solution is to run compiler in any IDE that supports java. For that it is needed to edit “Run Configurations” and give as input a command line option.
	Examples of pushing existing .ml file: “command line option” +
/tests/inputs/if_else.ml  
/tests/inputs/netset_let.ml  
/tests/inputs/pr.ml  
/tests/inputs/test_add.ml  
/tests/inputs/test_print42_1.ml 
/tests/inputs/test_print42.ml
    To see the results of compiler is possible just in console, not in the file.

1.3 Tests
	To run the tests it is needed to run “ make test”. The test results will be shown.

2. Command-line options

	Actions				Descriptions

	-h				Displays usage instructions
	-v 				Displays the version
	-asml <input file path>		Print the Asml
	-t <input file path>		Type checking 
	-p <input file path>		Only parse the input (no further processing)
	-o <output>			Optional. Specifies an output file; 
	-arm <input file path>		Generates ARM code and prints to console


3. Organization of the archive

ARM/     arm source example and compilation with libmincaml   
asml/    asml examples
doc/     all the documentation, start with index.hml
java/    MinCaml parser in Java + examples of tree traversal algo, if you do 
         the project in java  
mincaml/ MinCaml examples
ocaml/   MinCaml parser in OCaml, if you do the project in OCaml
scripts/ put your test scripts and symbolic links there, and add this 
         directory to your path
tests/   put your tests there
tools/   asml intepreter (linux binary)

We recommend that you add scripts/ and the dir that contains mincamlc to your
PATH.
